* ====================================
** 1. Building/Running the project JAR
* ====================================
Too build the JAR file of the project run the following command. Note that maven has to be installed and configured
correctly for this to work. If the build fails this is probably due to missing dependencies. There is only one dependency
that probably needs to be installed manually which the EIS package (See below for instructions on how to manually install
EIS in maven). All other dependencies should be automatically downloaded from the Internet if maven is configured correctly.

------------------------
Command for building JAR
------------------------

mvn clean package assembly:single


This will create 2 JAR files one without the dependencies and one including all the dependencies
Goto the target build directory to find the JAR file which can be used as a stand alone GOAL environment.
The JAR file is also executable but this will only show you the simulation environment and the cars will
do nothing if you run the simulation.

Please note that if the build command fails it is highly likely that the EIS dependency is not installed. 
To install EIS you would have to follow the next steps.



* ============================================
** 2. Installing EIS as on the local maven repo
* ============================================
1. Download the EIS package from the sf.net website
2. Extract and go into the bin directory
3. Run the following command to install EIS into local maven repo

-------
command
-------
mvn install:install-file -Dfile=eis-0.3.jar -DgroupId=apleis -DartifactId=eis -Dversion=0.3 -Dpackaging=jar -Djavadoc=eis-0.3-javadoc.jar -Dsources=eis-0.3-sources.jar

NOTE: If you are working with a newer version of the EIS package and you change the "0.3" version number you will also need to update
the pom.xml file accordingly.

** 3. Project Structure and Directories
* ============================================

src
|
-- goal                       (Contains the goal agents that were used and the MAS configuration)
|
-- main
|    |
|    -- java
|    |     |
|    |     -- apl             (contains the EIS connection implementation and simulation scenarios)
|    |     |
|    |     -- GUI             (Contains the simulation GUI, heavily changed from the original jModel/MOTUS simulator on which jSim is based on)
|    |     |
|    |     -- microModel      (Contains the mico-simulation core components, data objects, logging functionality, map import functionality, etc.)
|    |
|    -- resources             (Contains the example map files for the A16 highway and the maps used in the scenarios)
|
-- matlab                     (Contains matlab script I used to plot some data)
|
-- test                       (Contains Test cases for only some parts of the project)



NOTE: The project is a heavily modified version of the original jModel (or MOTUS) as they call it these days.
The microModel and GUI packages contain the remnants of what used to be the jModel code. I have heavily refactored
the code in these packages, renamed classes, added functionality to import maps which used to be matlab code in jModel.

** 4. OLD / DEPRECATED !!

*** IMPORTANT !!!!
*** Installing eis2Java is no longer needed because it is now packages as part of eis-0.3 ***

Installing eis2java as a maven dependency to the local repo
1. Download eis2java.jar
2. run the following command

mvn install:install-file -Dfile=eis2java.jar -DgroupId=apleis -DartifactId=eis2java -Dversion=0.1 -Dpackaging=jar
