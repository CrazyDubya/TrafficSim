# Traffic Simulation - Java to Python Conversion

## Overview

This project successfully converts the original Java-based TrafficSim application to a modern Python backend with a web-based frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Original vs. Converted Architecture

### Original Java Implementation
- **Backend**: Java with Swing GUI
- **Build System**: Maven (pom.xml)
- **Visualization**: Java Swing components
- **Main Classes**: jModel, jVehicle, jDriver, jLane, jModelGUI

### New Python Implementation
- **Backend**: Python with object-oriented design
- **Web Framework**: Simple HTTP server (expandable to Flask/FastAPI)
- **Frontend**: HTML5 + CSS3 + JavaScript
- **Visualization**: HTML5 Canvas with real-time updates
- **API**: RESTful endpoints for simulation control

## Key Features Converted

### ✅ Core Simulation Engine
- **Vehicle Physics**: Position, velocity, acceleration calculations
- **Driver Models**: IDM (Intelligent Driver Model) with different driver types
- **Lane Management**: Multi-lane highway with lane changing capabilities
- **Traffic Flow**: Density, flow, and speed calculations

### ✅ Simulation Controls
- Start, Pause, Resume, Stop, Reset simulation
- Step-by-step execution
- Real-time parameter updates
- Scenario loading (Simple 3-lane highway)

### ✅ Vehicle Management
- Add vehicles dynamically during simulation
- Different driver types: IDM, Aggressive, Normal, Cautious
- Vehicle state tracking: position, speed, acceleration, lane changes

### ✅ Real-time Visualization
- HTML5 Canvas-based highway visualization
- Vehicle rendering with color coding by driver type
- Lane markings and road infrastructure
- Real-time statistics display

### ✅ Web Interface
- Modern responsive design
- Control panel with intuitive buttons
- Statistics dashboard
- Real-time updates without page refresh
